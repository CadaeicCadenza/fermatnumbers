# Fermat numbers (OEIS A000215)

A regular prime-sided polygon cannot be constructed with only a straightedge and compass, except for the Fermat numbers.

A fermat-number-sided polygon is prime-sided and constructible at the same time, Fermat numbers have the following form:

The program should print out the fermat numbers.

Here are the first 9 Fermat numbers:

But if n â‰¥ 5, the number is not prime anymore.
